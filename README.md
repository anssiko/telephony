telephony
=========

The telephony API is described in the index.html.

The folder 'input_docs' contains old, or alternative versions.
Any System Applications member can submit an alternative specification in the
input_docs folder.

The folder 'split_spec' contains the specification split into
- use cases and requirements
- a core part as 'index.html',
- extension for supporting multiple SIM/telephony services
- extension for supporting multiparty calls
- extension for supporting telephony services.
All of these can be under separate development.
Alternative extensions as well can be stored here.
